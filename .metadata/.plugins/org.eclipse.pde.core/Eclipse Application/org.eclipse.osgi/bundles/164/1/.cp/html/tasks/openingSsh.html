<h1>Opening a Shell to an EC2 Instance</h1>

<p>
Once you have an EC2 instance running, you'll probably want to open a remote
shell to it sooner or later.  From the <a href="javascript:executeCommand(%22org.eclipse.ui.views.showView(org.eclipse.ui.views.showView.viewId=com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2.ui.views.InstanceView)%22)">
EC2 Instances view</a>, just right-click
the running instance you want to connect to, and select "Open shell" from
the context menu.

<h3>Private keys</h3>

<p>
In order to open a remote shell, you'll need the private key
from the key pair that launched the instance you selected.  You can quickly
tell if you have the private key for an instances key pair by the icon displayed
in the key pair column of the EC2 Instances view.

<h3>SSH clients</h3>

<p>
You'll also need an SSH client before you can open
a remote shell to an EC2 instance.  If you're running on Linux or Mac, you
should have everything you need already set up.  If you're on Windows, you'll
need to make sure you have the PuTTY and PuTTYgen programs installed.  If
you don't, you can <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">
download them for free</a>.  The first time you use a 
key pair in PuTTY, the AWS Toolkit will also launch PuTTYgen so that you can
convert the key pair to the format PuTTY understands.  After you've done that
once for your key pair, you won't have to do it again.  

<p>
If you're having problems getting your SSH client to open correctly, you can
check out the 
<a href="javascript:executeCommand(%22org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2.preferences.ExternalToolsPreferencePage)%22)">
External Tools preference page</a> for the AWS Toolkit.  Here you can 
fine tune how your SSH client is invoked and specify any additional options.
