<h1>Managing Security Groups</h1>

<p>
EC2 security groups are an important tool for controlling the security of
your EC2 instances.  You can use the EC2 Security Groups view to manage
your security groups, including creating and deleting groups as well as
managing the permissions granted to those groups.

<h3>Create a new security group</h3>

<p>
Right-click the security groups list in the security group view
and select "New Group" from the context
menu.  You'll need to give your security group a name (ex: webservers)
and a meaningful description (ex: open access for HTTP traffic).

<h3>Configure permissions</h3>

<p>
Once you've created your new security group, you can assign permissions to
control the types of traffic allowed into any EC2 instances
in that security group.  Right-click the permissions table in the EC2
Security Groups view after you've selected your new security group and 
select "Add Permissions" from the context menu.

<p>
There are a few different ways to assign permissions to a security group.
For more details on all the options you can check out the developer guide
for EC2.  For now, try simply opening a port or port range.  If you want
to allow SSH connections so that you can log into your remote host, select
port 22 with the TCP protocol.  

<h3>Network masks</h3>

<p>
The network mask option allows you to 
lock down what IPs are allowed to access the port and protocol you specified.
If you want to leave the permissions wide open for anyone on the internet
to access a port on your instance (ex: port 80 for HTTP traffic on a webserver)
then you'd want a netmask of 0.0.0.0/0.  You typically won't want to leave
more sensitive ports, such as SSH on port 22, wide open.  For these ports
you can use <a href="http://checkip.amazonaws.com/block">
http://checkip.amazonaws.com/block</a> to find out the most restrictive
netmask you can use to allow only your current Internet connection to 
access a port on your EC2 instance.
