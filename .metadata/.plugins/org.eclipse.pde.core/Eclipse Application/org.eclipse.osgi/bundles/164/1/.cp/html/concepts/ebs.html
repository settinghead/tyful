<h1>Elastic Block Storage</h1>

<p>
Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) is a new type of storage designed specifically 
for Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS allows you to create volumes that Amazon EC2 
instances can mount as devices. 

<p>
Amazon EBS volumes behave like raw unformatted external block devices. They have 
user-supplied device names and provide a block device interface.  You can load a 
file system on top of Amazon EBS volumes, or use them just as you would use a block device.

<p>
Since EBS volumes behave just like any other mounted hard drive you can do anything 
with them you would do with standard hard drives&#0151;even make a RAID array.

<p>
After writing data to an Amazon EBS volume, you can periodically create a snapshot 
of the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes or for data backup.

<p>
There is also a growing set of 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">
public data sets</a>, such as the Human Genome and US 
Census data, which you can use to make your own EBS Volumes.
