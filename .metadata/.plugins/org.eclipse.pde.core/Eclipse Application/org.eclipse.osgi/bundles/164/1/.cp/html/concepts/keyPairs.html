<h1>Key Pairs</h1>

<p>
Amazon EC2 key pairs allow you to access your EC2 instances securely without relying
on passwords in the <a href="amis.html">Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</a> you launch.

<p>
Key pairs consist of a public key and a private key.  Amazon holds onto the public
key portion for you, but only you have the private key.
When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you select a key pair
to launch that instance with, and only people with the private key for that key pair
are able be log into the new instance.

<p>
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse will attempt to locate the private key files for your 
Amazon EC2 key pairs by looking in the ".ec2" directory in your home directory and
looking for a file named after the key pair and ending with a ".pem" extension.

<p>
You can manage your Amazon EC2 key pairs from the
<a href="javascript:executeCommand(%22org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2.preferences.KeyPairsPreferencePage)%22)">
key pairs preference page</a> in the AWS Toolkit preferences.
