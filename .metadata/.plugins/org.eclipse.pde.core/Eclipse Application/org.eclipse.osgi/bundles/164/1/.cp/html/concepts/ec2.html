<h1>Amazon EC2</h1>

<p>
Amazon EC2 is a web service that enables you to launch and manage server 
instances in Amazon's data centers using APIs or available tools and 
utilities. You can use Amazon EC2 server instances at any time, for as long 
as you need, and for any legal purpose. If you need 100 instances for a 
two-day research project, sure. If you need a fleet of instances that can be 
scaled up and down to meet the traffic fluctuations of your Facebook 
application, no problem.

<p>
Instances are available in different sizes and configurations. This allows us
to provide different instance types that you can use to meet specific needs. 
For example, you might want to use an m1.small instance (one Amazon EC2 Compute 
Unit) as a web server, an m1.xlarge instance (eight Amazon EC2 Compute Units) as 
a database server, or an extra large High-CPU instance (twenty Amazon EC2 Compute 
Units) for processor-intensive applications.

<p>
Amazon EC2 is different because you use only the capacity that you need. 
This eliminates your need to make large and expensive hardware purchases, reduces 
the need to forecast traffic, and enables you to immediately deal with changes in 
requirements or spikes in popularity related to your application or service.
