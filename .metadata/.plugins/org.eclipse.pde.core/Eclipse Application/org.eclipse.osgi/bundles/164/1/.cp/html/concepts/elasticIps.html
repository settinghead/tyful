<h1>Elastic IPs</h1>

<p>
Elastic IP addresses are static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. Elastic IP addresses are associated with your account, not 
specific instances. Any elastic IP addresses that you associate with 
your account remain associated with your account until you explicitly 
release them. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, elastic 
IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by 
rapidly remapping your public IP addresses to any instance in your account.

<p>
Note: To ensure our customers are efficiently using elastic IP addresses, 
we impose a small hourly charge if these IP addresses are not mapped to 
an instance. When these IP addresses are mapped to an instance, they are 
free of charge.
