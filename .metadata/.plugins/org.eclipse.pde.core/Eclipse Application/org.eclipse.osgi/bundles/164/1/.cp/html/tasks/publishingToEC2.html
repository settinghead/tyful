<h1>Publishing a Java Web App to EC2</h1>

<p>
After you've created an EC2 Tomcat cluster, you'll want to get your
Java web application running on it.  The tools provided by the Web
Tools Platform make this a snap.

<h3>Select a resource to run</h3>

<p>
Open any resource that you'd like to run on your EC2 Tomcat cluster
(ex: a servlet or JSP file), right-click, and select Run on Server
from the context menu.

<h3>Select your cluster</h3>

<p>
Select the EC2 Tomcat cluster you want to publish to and finish the Run on Server wizard.

<p>
If this is the first time you're using your EC2 Tomcat cluster, you'll
have to wait a few minutes while your EC2 instances are booted up and
your applications are published.  The first time you publish a web
application to your EC2 Tomcat Cluster may take a few minutes, especially
for large applications that include many jar libraries.

<p>
If your EC2 Tomcat cluster was already running, the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse
only needs to publish any resources that you've changed since the last
time it published, so it should be much faster.

<p>
Once the AWS Toolkit finishes publishing your projects your resource
should open within a web browser in Eclipse.

<p>
If you just want to publish your application to your EC2 Tomcat cluster, but
aren't interested in running any of the resources, you can also right-click
your EC2 Tomcat cluster from the WTP servers view and select Publish
from the context menu or Start if your EC2 Tomcat cluster isn't running yet.
