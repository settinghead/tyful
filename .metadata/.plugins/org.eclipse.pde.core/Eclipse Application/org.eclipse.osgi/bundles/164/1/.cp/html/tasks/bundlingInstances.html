<h1>Bundling EC2 Instances</h1>

<p>
The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse automates the process of bundling AMIs.

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="javascript:executeCommand(%22org.eclipse.ui.views.showView(org.eclipse.ui.views.showView.viewId=com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2.ui.views.InstanceView)%22)">
EC2 Instances view</a>.
  <li>Right-click the running instance that you want to bundle.
  <li>Select "Bundle New AMI..." from the context menu.
  <li>Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you'd like to
store the AMI and the name you'd like to give for the new AMI's
manifest file.

<p>

<p>
Now you should see a new job running in the Progress view.
Bundling an instance, uploading it to Amazon S3,
and registering the new AMI with EC2 can often take ten or twenty
minutes to complete, so be patient.

<p>
If you run into problems with your Amazon S3 bucket, make sure you're
specifying a valid Amazon S3 bucket that isn't owned by another user.
