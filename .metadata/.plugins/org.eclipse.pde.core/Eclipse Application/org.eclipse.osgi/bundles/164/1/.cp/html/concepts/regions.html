<h1>Regions</h1>

<p>
Amazon EC2 provides multiple regions so you can launch Amazon EC2
instances in locations that meet your requirements. For example, 
you might want to launch instances in Europe to be closer to your 
European customers or to meet legal requirements.

<p>
Each Amazon EC2 region is designed to be completely isolated from 
the other Amazon EC2 regions. This achieves the greatest possible 
failure independence and stability, and it makes the locality of 
each EC2 resource unambiguous.
