<h1>Launching EC2 Instances</h1>

<p>
Launching EC2 instances is easy with the AWS Toolkit's launch wizard.

<h3>Select an AMI to launch</h3>

<p>
Open the <a href="javascript:executeCommand(%22org.eclipse.ui.views.showView(org.eclipse.ui.views.showView.viewId= com.amazonaws.eclipse.ec2.ui.views.AmiBrowserView)%22)">
AMI Browser view</a> provided by the 
AWS Toolkit for Eclipse and find the AMI you want to launch.  You can use
the search box in the top right corner of the AMI Browser view to find
the AMIs you're looking for.

<h3>Open the launch wizard</h3>

<p>
Once you've found your AMI, right-click it and select Launch from the
context menu.  The launch wizard walks you through launching a new EC2
instance.  Select how many instances you want launched and the key pair and
security group that you want them launched with.  If you haven't created
any key pairs or security groups yet, you can create them directly from
the launch wizard by right-clicking the appropriate widgets to access
the context menus.

After you've selected your launch options and finished the wizard, you should
see your new instance listed as pending in the EC2 Instances view.  This
means that EC2 is now launching your new instance; in a few minutes you will have
full access to it.
