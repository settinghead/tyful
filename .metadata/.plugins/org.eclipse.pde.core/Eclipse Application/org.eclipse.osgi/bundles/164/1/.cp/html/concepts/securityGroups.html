<h1>Security Groups</h1>

<p>
A security group is a named collection of access rules. These access 
rules specify which ingress (i.e. incoming) network traffic should be 
delivered to your instance. All other ingress traffic is discarded.

<p>
You can modify a group's rules at any time. The new rules are automatically 
enforced for all instances that are running or launched subsequently.

<p>
Security Group rules allow specific computers to access particular ports 
on your instance (e.g., port 80 for HTTP traffic), much like a traditional 
firewall. You can define the allowed computers using a range of IP addresses 
or by the Security Group to which they belong. For example, you may want to 
allow your webserver instances to talk to your DB servers. This can be 
done by creating a rule in your security group "Web Servers" that allows 
all connections from the group named "DB servers".
