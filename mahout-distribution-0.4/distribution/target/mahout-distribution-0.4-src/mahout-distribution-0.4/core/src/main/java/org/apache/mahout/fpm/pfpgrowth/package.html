Map/Reduce(Parallel) implementation of <b>FP Growth</b> Algorithm for frequent Itemset Mining
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
We have a Top K Parallel FPGrowth Implementation. What it means is that given a huge transaction list, we find all unique features(field values) 
 and eliminates those features whose frequency in the whole dataset is less that <i>minSupport</i>. Using these remaining 
 features N, we find the top K closed patterns for each of them, generating NK patterns. <i>FPGrowth</i> Algorithm is a generic implementation, we can use 
 any Object type to denote a feature. Current implementation requires you to use a String as the object type. You may implement a version for any object 
 by creating Iterators, Convertors and TopKPatternWritable for that particular object. For more information please refer the package 
 <i> org.apache.mahout.fpm.pfpgrowth.convertors.string </i> 
 <br>
 e.g:
 <pre>
 FPGrowth&lt;String&gt; fp = new FPGrowth&lt;String&gt;();
 Set&lt;String&gt; features = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
 fp.generateTopKStringFrequentPatterns(
     new StringRecordIterator(new FileLineIterable(new File(input), encoding, false), pattern), 
        fp.generateFList(
          new StringRecordIterator(new FileLineIterable(new File(input), encoding, false), pattern), minSupport),
         minSupport,
        maxHeapSize, 
        features,
        new StringOutputConvertor(new SequenceFileOutputCollector&lt;Text, TopKStringPatterns&gt;(writer))
  );
 </pre>
 <ul>
<li>The first argument is the iterator of transaction in this case its Iterator&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;
</li><li>The second argument is the output of generateFList function, which returns the frequent items and their frequencies from the given database transaction iterator 
</li><li>The third argument is the minimum Support of the pattern to be generated
</li><li>The fourth argument is the maximum number of patterns to be mined for each feature 
</li><li>The fifth argument is the set of features for which the frequent patterns has to be mined
</li><li>The last argument is an output collector which takes [key, value] of Feature and TopK Patterns of the format [String, List&lt;Pair&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, Long&gt;&gt;] and writes them to the appropriate writer class which takes care of storing the object, in this case in a Sequence File Output format
</li></ul>

<p>The command line launcher for string transaction data <i>org.apache.mahout.fpm.pfpgrowth.FPGrowthJob</i> has other features including specifying the regex pattern for spitting a string line of a transaction into the constituent features</p>
The <i>numGroups</i> parameter in FPGrowthJob specifies the number of groups into which transactions have to be decomposed. 
The <i>numTreeCacheEntries</i> parameter specifies the number of generated conditional FP-Trees to be kept in memory so as not to regenerate them. Increasing this number increases the memory consumption but might improve speed until a certain point. This depends entirely on the dataset in question. A value of 5-10 is recommended for mining up to top 100 patterns for each feature
