In-memory mapreduce implementation of <b>Random Decision Forests</b>
</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Each mapper is responsible for growing a number of trees with a whole copy of the dataset loaded in memory, it uses the reference implementation's code to build each tree and estimate the oob error.<br><br>
The dataset is distributed to the slave nodes using the <i>DistributedCache</i>. A custom <i>InputFormat</i> (InMemInputFormat) is configured with the desired number of trees and generates a number of <i>InputSplit</i>s (InMemInputSplit) equal to the configured number of maps (mapred.map.tasks).<br><br>
There is no need for reducers, each map outputs (MapredOutput) the trees it built and, for each tree, the labels the tree predicted for each out-of-bag instance. This step has to be done in the mapper because only there we know which instances are o-o-b.<br><br>
The Forest builder (InMemBuilder) is responsible for configuring and launching the job. At the end of the job it parses the output files and builds the corresponding <i>DecisionForest</i>, and for each tree prediction it calls (if available) a <i>PredictionCallback</i> that allows the caller to compute any error needed.
